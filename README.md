# todo-list

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the "Todo List App"! 📝

This project is a simple and user-friendly web application built using Node.js, EJS, HTML and CSS. With this app, you can easily keep track of your tasks and stay organized throughout your day.

This project demonstrates the power of Node.js on the server-side, combined with the versatility of HTML, CSS, and EJS on the client-side. It's a great starting point for developers interested in learning more about web development with these technologies.

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a foundation to build upon or customize it to fit your specific needs. Your feedback and contributions are highly appreciated as we continue to improve and expand this Todo List App.

Happy organizing and stay productive! 🚀
